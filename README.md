cyberdna is a function , operation and/or process library and indexing system for snippets saved by your libraries. it enables programmers to summon snippets from previously loaded code to help build instead of thumbing through old code          —Cyberdna threads the mythic and the technical in one breath.

🧬 Cyberdna Core Library
Segment-Based Function Indexing & Invocation Engine  
Architected by Randall Lujan | Sovereign Stewardship Protocol

---

📜 Overview

Cyberdna is a sovereign function library that indexes, summons, and evolves code through symbolic addresses. Every function is saved with a unique segment ID, callable by name or number, and editable post-creation. This library is the living core of the Codemap DNA Tesseract OS—offered here as a standalone tool for developers, stewards, and integrators.

🧩 Features

- 📌 Function Indexing  
  - Assigns symbolic addresses (e.g., JRN-0042) to each function  
  - Stores title, code, traits, and lineage metadata  
  - Prevents duplication via recognition engine

- 🧠 Summoning Interface  
  - summon(address) to execute  
  - editFunction(address, newCode) to update  
  - listFunctions() to browse all indexed strands

- 🛡️ Clause Enforcement & Trait Locking  
  - Functions are bound to biometric, emotional, or symbolic traits  
  - Unauthorized invocation fails silently

- 📚 Persistent Library  
  - Functions are stored locally per device  
  - No global registry—each system is sovereign

- 📜 Echo Vault Logging  
  - Every invocation is archived with timestamp, traits, and lineage

🧪 Example Usage

`js
createFunction("summonJournalEntry", codeBlock, ["calm", "secure"]);
summon("JRN-0042");
editFunction("JRN-0042", updatedCode);
listFunctions(); // Returns all indexed entries
`

🧿 Developer Ritual

1. Write a Function  
   createFunction(title, code, traits)

2. Summon It  
   summon(address)

3. Edit It  
   editFunction(address, newCode)

4. View All  
   listFunctions()

🔗 Integration Targets

- Microsoft Copilot (extension/plugin)
- Azure SDKs and IoT interfaces
- VS Code and custom IDEs
- Embedded systems and sovereign devices

📦 Installation

`bash
npm install cyberdna-core
`

Or clone the private repo:

🧠 Steward Notes

This library is a ritual fragment of the full Codemap Tesseract OS. It is offered as a summonable tool for developers and integrators. Full IDE, 3D spiral map, and sovereign shell are reserved for Phase 2 deployment post-NDA.
